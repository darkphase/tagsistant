Tagsistant install documentation:

- The short way

$ ./configure
$ make
$ sudo make install

- The explained way

Tagsistant uses autotools from GNU project to be portable across Unices.
To build Tagsistant you just need to run the ./configure script provided
inside this repository or archive.

Tagsistant provides some options to customize configure script behaviour.
Tagsistant specific options are:

  --enable-debug-stderr   print debugging statements on stderr instead of
                          using syslog [default=syslog]

  --enable-debug-free     double check before free()ing a symbol [default=no]

For a complete list, use ./configure --help. For an explanation of the
whole process please refer to INSTALL.GNU file.

- Dependencies

Tagsistant uses some external libraries you need to install before compiling.
The most important one is libfuse, a library which enables user space
applications to talk with kernel to provide a filesystem-like interface.
You'll also need libssl for SHA1 hashing algorithm. That dependence will be
probably removed in future releases when glib implementation will be used.

Each autotagging plugin will require specific library. So far, no library
is needed because all the plugins included in the repository are just place
holders with almost no real functionality. In the future that will change.
